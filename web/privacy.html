        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="legal__updated">Last Updated: January 25, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to ItoMcovertor. This Privacy Policy explains how ItoMcovertor ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses,
            discloses, and safeguards your information when you visit our website located at https://itomcovertor.com
            (the "Website") and use our browser extension (the "Extension"), collectively referred to as the "Services."
            Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge that you have
            read, understood, and agree to be bound by all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with
            the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you
            about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to
            periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made
            aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy
            by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction and Overview</h2>

        <p>ItoMcovertor is a free, open-source unit conversion tool designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We
            believe that users should be able to perform unit conversions without sacrificing their privacy or being
            tracked across the internet. This commitment to privacy is reflected in every aspect of how we design and
            operate our Services.</p>

        <p>Unlike many online tools and services, ItoMcovertor does not collect, store, transmit, or process any
            personal information about its users. All conversion calculations are performed entirely within your web
            browser or browser extension, meaning your data never leaves your device and is never sent to our servers or
            any third-party servers.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with complete transparency about our data practices. We want
            you to understand exactly what information, if any, is collected when you use our Services, how that
            information is used, and what choices you have regarding your information.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

        <p>To be absolutely clear about our commitment to your privacy, we want to explicitly state the types of
            information that we DO NOT collect:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Identification Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone
                number, mailing address, date of birth, social security number, or any other information that could be
                used to personally identify you.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We do not require you to create an account, and therefore we do
                not collect usernames, passwords, or any account-related information.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> We do not collect credit card numbers, bank account information,
                or any other financial data. Our Services are completely free, and we do not process any payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Biometric Data:</strong> We do not collect fingerprints, facial recognition data, voiceprints,
                or any other biometric identifiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect your geographic location, GPS coordinates, IP-based
                location, or any other location-related information.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect information about your device, including but not
                limited to device type, operating system, browser type, browser version, screen resolution, or unique
                device identifiers.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any other analytics
                or tracking tools. We do not track which pages you visit, how long you spend on our site, what
                conversions you perform, or any other usage patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversions and Calculations:</strong> The unit conversions you perform are processed entirely
                in your browser. We do not log, store, or have any access to the values you input or the results you
                receive.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Queries:</strong> We do not collect or log any search queries or conversion requests you
                make.</li>
            <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> We do not access, collect, or store your browsing history from other
                websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Lists:</strong> We do not access or collect information from your contact lists, address
                books, or any other personal directories.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media Information:</strong> We do not collect information from your social media
                accounts, nor do we integrate with any social media platforms for tracking purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>

        <p>While we do not collect any information on our servers, our Services may store certain information locally on
            your device to enhance your user experience. This information is stored using your browser's built-in
            storage mechanisms (localStorage and cookies) and never leaves your device. You have complete control over
            this locally stored information and can delete it at any time.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Cookie Consent Preference</h3>

        <p>When you first visit our Website, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner asking whether you wish
            to allow us to store data locally on your device. Your response to this consent request is stored in a
            cookie on your device so that we do not need to ask you again on subsequent visits. This cookie is named
            "unitConverter_cookieConsent" and contains only your consent preference (accepted or declined). This cookie
            expires after one (1) year from the date it is set.</p>

        <h3>3.2 User Preferences and Settings</h3>

        <p>If you consent to local storage, we may store your user preferences and settings in your browser's
            localStorage. These preferences may include, but are not limited to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme Preference:</strong> Whether you prefer the light theme or dark theme for the user
                interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal Places:</strong> Your preferred number of decimal places for conversion results.</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Notation:</strong> Whether you prefer results to be displayed in scientific notation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Default Units:</strong> Your preferred default units for various conversion categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Options:</strong> Various display preferences such as showing or hiding certain UI
                elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information is stored in a localStorage item named "unitConverter_settings" and remains on your device
            until you clear your browser data or explicitly delete it through our interface.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Conversion History</h3>

        <p>If you consent to local storage, our Services may store a limited history of your recent conversions to allow
            you to quickly access and repeat previous calculations. This history is stored locally on your device and
            typically includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The source unit and target unit of the conversion</li>
            <li>The input value and resulting output value</li>
            <li>The timestamp of when the conversion was performed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This conversion history is stored in a localStorage item named "unitConverter_history" and is limited to the
            most recent ten (10) conversions. Older entries are automatically removed when new conversions are added.
            You can clear this history at any time by clicking the "Clear" button in the conversion history panel or by
            clearing your browser's localStorage for our domain.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Your Control Over Local Storage</h3>

        <p>You have complete control over the information stored locally on your device. You can:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decline Cookies:</strong> When presented with the cookie consent banner, you can choose to
                decline, and no data will be stored on your device. The Services will continue to function normally, but
                your preferences will not be saved between visits.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Conversion History:</strong> You can clear your conversion history at any time by clicking
                the "Clear" button in the history panel.</li>
            <li><strong>Reset All Settings:</strong> You can reset all settings to their default values through the
                Settings panel.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Browser Data:</strong> You can use your browser's built-in tools to clear cookies and
                localStorage for our Website, which will remove all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Private/Incognito Mode:</strong> Using your browser's private or incognito mode will prevent
                any data from being stored persistently on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Browser Extension Permissions and Data Practices</h2>

        <p>The ItoMcovertor browser extension is designed with the same privacy-first principles as our Website. The
            extension requests minimal permissions necessary to provide its functionality:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Storage Permission</h3>

        <p>The extension requests the "storage" permission to save your user preferences (such as theme preference and
            display options) locally within the extension's storage area. This storage is isolated to the extension and
            is not accessible by websites or other extensions. The data stored includes the same types of preferences
            described in Section 3.2 above. This storage is synced across your browsers if you are signed into your
            browser account with sync enabled.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Active Tab Permission (Optional)</h3>

        <p>The extension may request the "activeTab" permission, which is only used when you explicitly activate the
            auto-convert feature. This permission allows the extension to read text that you have selected on the
            current webpage so that it can identify numbers with units and offer to convert them. This permission is
            considered optional because:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>It is only activated when you explicitly request it (e.g., by clicking the extension icon or using a
                keyboard shortcut)</li>
            <li>It only has access to the currently active tab, not your browsing history or other tabs</li>
            <li>It only reads the selected text, not the entire page content</li>
            <li>The text is processed entirely locally and is never transmitted to any servers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 No Background Data Collection</h3>

        <p>The extension does not run any background processes that collect data. It does not monitor your browsing
            activity, track the websites you visit, record your keystrokes, or perform any other form of surveillance.
            The extension only becomes active when you explicitly interact with it.</p>

        <h3>4.4 No Network Requests</h3>

        <p>The extension does not make any network requests to external servers. All conversion calculations are
            performed locally using the mathematical formulas built into the extension. The extension does not phone
            home, check for updates through its own mechanisms (browser-managed updates only), or transmit any data
            whatsoever.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>Our Services use a minimal number of third-party services. We have carefully selected these services and only
            use those that are necessary for the proper functioning of our Website:</p>

        <h3>5.1 Google Fonts</h3>

        <p>We use Google Fonts to load the "Rubik" font family to ensure consistent typography across different devices
            and browsers. When you visit our Website, your browser may make a request to Google's servers to download
            the font files. Google may collect certain technical information as part of this request, including your IP
            address and browser information. This data collection is governed by Google's Privacy Policy, which can be
            found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <p>If you wish to prevent this connection to Google's servers, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a browser extension that blocks connections to Google Fonts</li>
            <li>Configure your browser to block web fonts</li>
            <li>Use a privacy-focused browser that provides built-in font blocking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If Google Fonts is blocked, the Website will still function normally but may display using your system's
            default fonts.</p>

        <h3>5.2 GitHub</h3>

        <p>Our source code is hosted on GitHub, and we may link to our GitHub repository from our Website. If you choose
            to visit our GitHub page, report issues, or contribute to the project, your interaction with GitHub is
            governed by GitHub's Privacy Statement, available at <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement</a>.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons / Edge Add-ons</h3>

        <p>Our browser extension is distributed through official browser extension stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox
            Add-ons, Microsoft Edge Add-ons, etc.). When you install, update, or interact with our extension through
            these stores, your activity is subject to the respective platform's privacy policies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Chrome Web Store: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
            <li>Firefox Add-ons: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/</a></li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge Add-ons: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Cookies We Use</h3>

        <p>We want to be explicit about the tracking technologies that we DO NOT use:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel, or any
                other analytics platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> We do not display advertisements and do not use any advertising
                cookies or tracking pixels.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media Cookies:</strong> We do not integrate social media widgets that set cookies (such
                as Facebook Like buttons or Twitter embeds).</li>
            <li><strong>Fingerprinting:</strong> We do not use browser fingerprinting, canvas fingerprinting, or any
                other fingerprinting techniques to identify or track users.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Pixels:</strong> We do not use tracking pixels, web beacons, or clear GIFs.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Replay Tools:</strong> We do not use Hotjar, FullStory, or any other session replay
                tools that record user interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Site Tracking:</strong> We do not engage in any form of cross-site tracking or
                retargeting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 How to Manage Cookies</h3>

        <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. Here are instructions for common
            browsers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Privacy and security &gt; Cookies and other site
                data. Here you can clear existing cookies and configure how Chrome handles cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Cookies and Site Data.
                You can clear data and manage cookie permissions.</li>

                remove cookies for specific sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Privacy, search, and services &gt; Clear browsing
                data. You can also configure cookie settings under Cookies and site permissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please note that if you delete the cookie consent cookie, you will be shown the consent banner again on your
            next visit to our Website.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>

        <p>Although we do not collect or store any user data on our servers, we are committed to ensuring that our
            Services are secure and do not expose users to unnecessary risks. Our security measures include:</p>

        <h3>7.1 HTTPS Encryption</h3>

        <p>Our Website is served exclusively over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which encrypts all
            communication between your browser and our servers. This prevents third parties from intercepting or
            modifying the content of the Website as it travels over the internet.</p>

        <h3>7.2 No Server-Side Data Storage</h3>

        <p>Since we do not collect or store any user data on our servers, there is no database of user information that
            could be breached, hacked, or leaked. Your data remains entirely on your own device.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Open Source Code</h3>

        <p>Our source code is open source and available for public inspection on GitHub. This transparency allows
            security researchers and the general public to review our code and verify that it does what we claim it
            does. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them through our GitHub repository.</p>

        <h3>7.4 Regular Updates</h3>

        <p>We regularly update our Services to address any security issues, fix bugs, and improve functionality. We
            encourage users to keep their browser and browser extensions up to date to benefit from the latest security
            improvements.</p>

        <h3>7.5 Content Security Policy</h3>

        <p>We implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code
            injection vulnerabilities. This policy restricts the sources from which scripts, styles, and other resources
            can be loaded.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
            information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, this
            applies equally to users of all ages. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has
            provided personal information to us, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have
            collected personal information from anyone, regardless of age, we will take steps to delete that
            information.</p>

        <p>Our Services are designed to be educational and can be used by students of all ages for homework, school
            projects, and learning about unit conversions. Since no data is collected, children can use our Services
            without any privacy concerns.</p>

        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>

        <p>Since we do not collect, store, or process any user data on our servers, there are no international data
            transfers to disclose. All data processing occurs locally on your own device, which means your data never
            crosses borders or is subject to the data protection laws of other jurisdictions.</p>

        <p>The only exception is the connection to Google Fonts (as described in Section 5.1), which may result in your
            IP address being transmitted to Google's servers, which may be located outside your country of residence.
            This connection is made directly from your browser to Google's servers and is subject to Google's Privacy
            Policy.</p>

        <h2>10. Your Privacy Rights</h2>

        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. While we do
            not collect personal information, we want to be transparent about how these rights apply to our Services:
        </p>

        <h3>10.1 European Union (GDPR)</h3>

        <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not collect personal data:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> There is no personal data for us to provide access to.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> There is no personal data for us to correct.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> There is no personal data for us to delete. However, you can delete
                any locally stored data at any time using your browser's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> There is no personal data processing to restrict.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> There is no personal data for us to transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> There is no personal data processing to object to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10.2 California (CCPA)</h3>

        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
            Since we do not collect, sell, or share personal information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> We do not collect personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> There is no personal information for us to delete.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong> We do not sell or share personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against users for exercising their
                privacy rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10.3 Other Jurisdictions</h3>

        <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction with specific data protection laws (such as Brazil's LGPD, Canada's
            PIPEDA, or other regional laws), please be assured that we do not collect, store, or process any personal
            information. The same principles described above apply regardless of your location.</p>

        <h2>11. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

        <p>Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that the user does not want to
            be tracked. Since we do not track users in any way, we effectively honor DNT signals by default. Our
            behavior is the same regardless of whether you have DNT enabled in your browser—we simply do not track you.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Links to Other Websites</h2>

        <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites and services that are not operated by us. These links
            are provided for your convenience and reference only. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility
            for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.</p>

        <p>We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. When you click on a third-party
            link, you will be directed to that third party's site, and their privacy policy will apply to your
            interaction with that site.</p>

        <h2>13. Open Source Commitment</h2>

        <p>ItoMcovertor is an open-source project. Our commitment to transparency extends beyond this Privacy Policy to
            the very code that powers our Services. You can review, audit, and verify our data practices by examining
            our source code on GitHub.</p>

        <p>Being open source means:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Anyone can verify that we do what we say we do</li>
            <li>Security researchers can identify and report vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>The community can contribute improvements and fixes</li>
            <li>Our code can be forked and modified if users have different privacy requirements</li>
            <li>There are no hidden features or undisclosed data collection mechanisms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal
            requirements, or other factors. When we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will:</p>

        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your
            privacy. Your continued use of our Services after the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes
            your acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <p>The history of changes to this Privacy Policy may be tracked through our public GitHub repository, where all
            changes to our codebase, including this Privacy Policy, are version-controlled and publicly accessible.</p>
