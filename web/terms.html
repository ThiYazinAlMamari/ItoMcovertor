        <h2>4. Accuracy and Disclaimer</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Accuracy of Conversions</h3>

        <p>While we strive to provide accurate conversion results based on internationally recognized standards and
            conversion factors, ItoMcovertor is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We use precise
            mathematical formulas and regularly verify our conversion factors, but we cannot guarantee that all
            conversions will be 100% accurate in all circumstances.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Critical Applications</h3>

        <p>For critical applications including but not limited to:</p>

            <li>Any situation where inaccurate conversions could result in harm</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You should verify conversions using additional authoritative sources and professional tools. ItoMcovertor is
            intended to be a helpful utility tool, not a replacement for professional calculation software in
            safety-critical applications.</p>
